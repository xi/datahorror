You push against the door – it creaks open slowly giving you a glimpse into the
room. There's a desk light on, and it looks like someone was there maybe a
moment ago, but as the door fully opens, still no-one speaks... so you gingerly
step inside.

Professor Hutseephluts doesn't appear to be there. Maybe you should just leave.

But suddenly, the door shuts behind you with a loud bang followed by a series
of clicks. Did the door just lock itself shut? If so, you’re trapped in the
office. What do you do?
