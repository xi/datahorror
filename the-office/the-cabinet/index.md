The filing cabinet looks old, battered and heavily used. Probably the Professor
is storing lots of research data inside it alongside important documents. You
try to open it, but it's locked. On top of it lies a note with a mysterious
list.

1 - The subject of your data.
2 - Your name.
3 - Your age when you collected the data.
4 - The period in which your data were collected.
5 - How much time you spent writing your article.
6 - The data format(s).
7 - The length of time it takes you to commute to the university.
8 - The data volume.
9 - The cost of the storage space.
10 - The terms of use.
11 - The number of slices of pumpkin pie you ate during the data collection.
12 - The publication(s) connected to these data.
13 - The number of times your publication was downloaded.
14 - Your favourite fictional ghost.

Can you crack the code of the cabinet by indicating which details about your
research would be necessary for a PhD candidate to download, understand,
interpret and use your data? Write your answer as 1-2-3-4...

1-2-4-6-8-10-12

The filing cabinet creaks while you pull it open. It's empty, except for one
sheet of paper. In thick, dark letters, there's just one word: HORROR. Shiver,
and make a note of it
