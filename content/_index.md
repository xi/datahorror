Dear Guest,

Welcome to our Escape Room. We are so happy to see you here!

    engines. If you do need something outside of this escape room, we
    will provide a link to it.
-   This escape room is meant to be a playful exercise; please don\'t
    break anything or use brute force to solve a puzzle.
-   This escape room can be completed in roughly 1 hour.
-   If you dare, feel free to invite others to enter the Data Horror
    Escape Room.

## Want to know more about research data management?

Research Data Management (RDM) refers to a set of practices to ensure
responsible handling of data in scientific research. It is important
before, during, and after your research. Part of good RDM is writing a
Data Management Plan (DMP) to record decisions about how you are going
to manage your data.

Most universities in the Netherlands have teams of experts to help
researchers with various RDM-related questions. Depending on your
affiliation, check out the RDM resources and support at [VU Amsterdam](https://libguides.vu.nl/rdm),
[Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/rdm) and
[Leiden University](https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/researchers/data-management).
