The escape room website was launched during Data Horror Week 2020 in the
Netherlands, and played live at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam on 29
October 2020.

The website and the puzzles were created by a collaborative team from
the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Leiden University and the Eindhoven
University of Technology. They were inspired by the ideas of and the
escape room created by Lieke Mulder and Merel Talbi.

If you have questions or remarks about this website or the puzzles, you are
