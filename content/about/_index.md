This is a playful way to teach researchers about Research Data Management (RDM).

It is based on <https://sites.google.com/vu.nl/datahorror/> by Vrije
Universiteit Amsterdam, Leiden University and Eindhoven University of
Technology.

Currently it is just a cleaned-up version of the original. I hope that over
time, we can update outdated content, make it applicable outside of the
Netherlands, and fine-tune the game mechanics.
