You've received an urgent message from Professor Hutseephluts asking you to
come to an old office hidden away on the top floor. It’s Thursday, half past
six, and you’d rather go home, but you've never met the Professor and the email
was rather stern, so you don’t dare to refuse.

The Professor is well known for collaborating with people from many different
disciplines and although the research area is very obscure, you know that by
reputation, the Professor is always open and gets high impact results. You also
heard a rumour that the Professor might have won a very large research grant
recently, so you wonder if the invitation might lead to an opportunity to work
together.

With every step you climb, you see fewer people, and by the time you’ve reached
the office on the top floor, the whole building seems to be empty. You hear
your footsteps echo through the hall and see a crack of light under the door at
the far end of the corridor.

"It’s not FAIR!", you mutter to yourself but there's no-one around to hear you
complain.

You reach the office door and politely knock. You knock again. But there's no
answer.
