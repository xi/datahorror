# Postcard

The back of the postcard reads:

> Mexico City, 2nd September
>
> Dear Professor Hutseephluts,
>
> We enjoyed meeting you at the recent FAIR training in Bratislava. It was very
> inspirational.
>
> My colleague has been studying the distribution of parasitic infections of
> bats across the world and I believe there might be a correlation between
> certain bat infections and the number of spectral apparitions that are
> observed in a place. I think it would be very interesting to combine the
> dataset with yours.
>
> Have you been using a standard metadata scheme for identifying countries or
> geographic locations of your observances? We must agree on a standard way of
> identifying the locations of our bat infections and spectral incidents so
> that we can easily combine our datasets to look for these correlations.
>
> Such a surprising positive result would lead to opportunities for further
> investigation of the causes and we would already propose to collect blood
> serum and brain imaging/MRI data from your human case studies and from our
> bats. We must discuss how we will collect and organise this data so that we
> can make our datasets “interoperable”.
>
> Let us not waste time! We could expect to produce together a high impact
> paper in, for example, Nature.
>
> Please take a look at the dataset I am referring to using the following DOI:
> 10.5281/zenodo.3369922
>
> Yours, in academic respect,
>
> Marisela
