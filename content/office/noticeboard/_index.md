On the wall by Professor Hutseephluts' desk hangs a noticeboard. Papers are
pinned all over it in a confusion of printouts, flyers, pictures, reminders,
and souvenirs from travels around the world.

There is a calendar on which the Professor has circled several dates and
post-it notes scribbled in frantic handwriting are stuck around it. The post-it
notes seem to relate to the circled dates:

-   6 July: meet PhD candidate, Bucharest.
-   23 July: deadline funding proposal!!
-   10 August: FAIR data training, Bratislava!
-   14 September: make data interoperable for Marisel.
-   31 October: deadline for submitting data management plan!!!

Among the pinned sheets of paper containing familiar-looking details of faculty
events, travel itineries, book lists and photos, there is a postcard that seems
to have been pinned on the board slightly apart from everything else, and a
strange sheet of paper printed with, what looks like, random letters and
numbers. Perhaps it is a code!
