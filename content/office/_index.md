So this is the office of Professor Hutseephluts. Although it's dimly lit, as
far as you can tell, it looks pretty much like any other researcher's office.

There is a large desk with a computer on it. Before the desk is an old swivel
chair, sagging with cushions, where it looks like the Professor spends long
hours. On one wall you see a noticeboard with papers pinned almost all over it
and on another wall a large map. Next to the desk there's a waste paper bin
almost overflowing with papers...nothing unusual there, and next to that a
filing cabinet. A second chair sits in the corner of the room where a
travelling bag and its contents seem to have been hastily emptied out.
