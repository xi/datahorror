The old papers are bundled in packs and bound with string.
You open up a couple of them, and as far as you can tell, each one contains
data, preprints, and notes relating to a particular publication.

You notice that some stacks also seem to contain personal data. You wonder
whether it is ok to just throw them in the trash. Shouldn't these be disposed
of via confidential waste?

If you start to go through all of these you really will be here all night...
