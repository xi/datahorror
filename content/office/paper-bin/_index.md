The waste paper bin in the office of Professor Hutseephluts is atonishingly
full, which is weird because you know that all the waste paper bins at the
department were emptied by the cleaner yesterday. The Professor must be
throwing away lots of rubbish, or is this old data? It seems a funny way to do
your archiving.

There's an enormous pile of old, yellowed papers which have buried three fresh
and new-looking documents at the bottom of the bin. Was the Professor trying to
hide these?

Do you have time to look through everything?
