You open the booklet and hold it next to the camera menu. This is what it says:

> Jane is working on a study where she interviews employees about their work
> satisfaction. She is planning to hire an agency to do the transcription of the
> interviews. She will also use market analysis data to see if there are
> correlations between the level of satisfaction and the success of the company.
>
> Which activities will help her produce a FAIR dataset that allows others to
> replicate or build upon her research?
>
> 1.  Making the contract with the agency doing the transcription of the
>     interviews publicly available.
> 2.  Putting a link on her personal website to the original interview files and
>     the personal data of the people she interviewed.
> 3.  Discussing with her supervisor who will be allowed what level of access to
>     the dataset and when
> 4.  Checking what keywords are used by colleagues to categorize the market
>     analysis and including these terms in the description of the data
> 5.  Keeping a record of how she manipulates the data and what all her codes
>     mean.
> 6.  Adding a note in her publications to say that researchers interested in the
>     data are welcome to contact her for more details. Because the interview data
>     are qualitative there is no need to share them, or include any metadata or
>     explanations
> 7.  Finding a trusted data repository that is well-known and used by other
>     researchers in the field to deposit their data,  checking if the repository
>     assigns a persistent identifier, and whether access and authorization
>     procedures are in place.
> 8.  Keeping a full list of satisfied ghosts she met at the agency doing the
>     transcription
