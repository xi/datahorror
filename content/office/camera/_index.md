There is a video camera lying on the chair in the corner of the room. It looks
like it was recently taken out of the bag that's also on the chair. You've
heard that the Professor had just returned from some travels.

You seem to remember that someone told you that the Professor's research
involved filming interviews with people, and sometimes even leaving the camera
running in case it caught any 'data' on camera. The Professor had a reputation
for using up huge amounts of storage space for these films. You've heard the IT
support team, and other researchers grumble about it, especially as none of
these films have yet made it into research publications, but then perhaps they
contained personal or sensitive data, or were just too big to publish.. Some of
the films were made decades ago so nobody knew if the Professor was still
planning on using them, or even if you could still open the files.

You pick up the camera and switch it on. You press on some buttons on the
camera and a menu shows up. It says: enter the FAIR code.
