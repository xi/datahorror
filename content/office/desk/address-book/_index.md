Well done! Any data collected from or about people are personal data.

Last year five studies were conducted in which personal data were collected:

A.  This study collected participants’ age
B.  This study collected participants’ place of birth
C.  This study collected participants’ IP address
D.  This study collected participants’ eye colour
E.  This study collected participants’ blood type

Put the studies in chronological order. You are given the following clues:

-   The second study did not collect IP addresses or blood types
-   The largest study was the study collecting eye colour
-   The study collecting blood types was conducted before the study collecting IP addresses
-   The study collecting places of birth was not the last study
-   The study collecting ages was conducted after the study collecting IP addresses
-   The largest study was conducted first
-   What is the correct order of the studies? Write your answer as A-B-C-D-E
