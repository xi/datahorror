The Professor might have left the office open, but at least the computer is
locked so no-one can mess with his files.

The computer might offers a way out of the office. But… you need a
password…. Maybe the clues are in this room.

<form novalidate>
  <label>
    Enter the pass code sentence to access the computer (ALL CAPS)
    <input required pattern="GOOD PLANNING HELPS AVOID DATA HORROR" class="w-100">
  </label>
  <p class="form-if-incorrect">That's not it.</p>
  <div class="form-if-correct">
    <p>
      You unlock the computer and frantically begin to write a Data Management
      Plan (DMP), using all the details you learned about Professor Hutseephluts'
      research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as you finish typing the final sentence, an elderly man enters the room.
      "I just stepped out to grab some coffee," he says, exhaling a weary sigh.
      "This Data Management Plan is driving me to my last nerve. This would all
      have been much simpler if I had thought about it from the start!"
    </p>
    <p><strong>Congratulations. You have finished the game!</strong></p>
    <p>Just to be sure, you should <a href="./dmp/">read the DMP</a> one final time before submitting it.</p>
