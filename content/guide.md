# Data Horror Escape Room: facilitator’s guide and cheat sheet*

Licensed with CC0 1.0

*WARNING: contains answers!!!

The Data Horror Escape Room is an online game primarily designed to be played by
university staff (both researchers and research support staff) and students. It introduces and
enables discussion around research data management (RDM) concepts in a fun way. It was
created for an event that took place on Halloween during Data Horror Week, October 2020,
so it has a spooky, Halloween theme, but the game can be played at any time of the year.

The game was designed to be played in small groups, with a facilitator supporting and
helping the groups when needed, and then stimulating reflection and discussion between
the groups. The facilitator should ideally, therefore, have some knowledge about RDM and
be able to answer questions. The following notes are intended to help you prepare to host
and facilitate an interactive session using the Data Horror Escape Room.

The Data Horror Escape Room is an open website and can be found at
<https://sites.google.com/vu.nl/datahorror/home>.
An online escape room is a set of web pages containing puzzles that must be solved in order
to ‘unlock’ a door that allows the participants to 'escape' and therefore complete the game.
No prior knowledge of escape rooms or research data management is required to play the
game.

## Preparation

We highly recommend that you complete the game yourself before facilitating a session for
others, and of course, you might like to recruit some friends or colleagues to play with you
and help out as it is more fun to play the game with others.

To give you the same experience that your gamers will have, we recommend playing the
game before reading the sections below containing spoilers (these are clearly indicated).

We advise you not to give away any information in advance that will enable your
participants to find and play the game before your session. Once the game is completed, it is
very easy to play again, so if people have already tried it out, it will spoil the fun.

### How long does it take?

-   The Data Horror Escape Room takes a minimum of 40 minutes with fast work and
    excellent team collaboration; more commonly, it takes around one hour or slightly
    longer.
-   We recommend a session of 1 hour 30 minutes for introduction, game, and
    post-game discussion.
-   If you have a session of less than an hour, you can start the game during the session
    and invite participants to complete it together, or alone, after the session. Because
    the room is an open website, participants can access it at any time.
-   To continue the game at a later date, participants should make a note of which
    puzzles have been solved because the website does not track, or record any
    information from individual players.
-   If your session isn't long enough to play the game to the end, participants will still
    have encountered aspects of research data management that can be discussed and
    you can focus on these, avoiding discussing how the puzzles are actually solved.
-   Try to keep the introduction brief to maximize time for completion and allow the
    participants to discover for themselves how the game works. It's likely that some of
    your participants will have played an escape room before, and they will be able to get
    going very quickly. For those less experienced, offer individual support to help them
    on their way.

### How do I set things up?

-   Every team needs at least one computer and an internet connection.
-   Participants will also need to make a few small notes so either you can ensure they
    have pens and paper, or you can suggest they make notes on their computer or
    mobile phone.
-   At one point during the game, participants will encounter a video that they need to
    watch. It has sound, but can be played on mute with subtitles.
-   The ideal team size is 2-6 people. You can have as many teams as you wish playing
    simultaneously.
-   You can consider having a prize for the fastest team to complete the game.

### Notes for playing during a virtual/online event

-   If playing the game during an online event, plan the following in advance:
    -   how to divide the group into teams,
    -   how to answer questions from the teams whilst playing the game,
    -   how to send information, if needed, to all teams during the game,
    -   what instructions to give teams who are not physically co-located (for
        example, one person will need to share their screen and control the mouse),
    -   what to do when some teams have finished the game and others are still
        playing.
-   If using Zoom, it is easiest to use the Breakout Rooms with the self-assign
    functionality, then participants can sort themselves into the breakout rooms of their
    choice. Sorting a large number of participants into breakout rooms as a facilitator is
    overwhelming and takes some time.

### What happens when people finish?

-   Consider whether, and therefore how, you would like participants to confirm they
    have completed the game. If they complete it during the session they might just
    shout out, if they complete it afterwards, you could ask them to make a screenshot
    when they escape, with or without timestamp.
-   Make plans to keep players busy after completing the game whilst they wait for the
    other teams to finish. For example, you could provide prompts for each team to
    discuss among themselves topics raised in the game, or you could provide other
    RDM materials to look at and discuss.
-   When all teams have finished the game, or you decide that the time is over (and they
    can complete the game after the session), take a look at the discussion points below.

## Starting the session

Some participants might not have previously encountered an escape room game. If so, a
small amount of explanation is useful. Sometimes, other participants are keen to explain
their own experiences of escape rooms to the group.

A digital escape room is a series of puzzles that must be solved in order to ‘unlock’ a door
that allows the participants to 'escape' and therefore complete the game. The game will
guide you, and there are hints, but you should be able to figure out what to do and how to
do it whilst playing the game. It should be clear to you when you have completed the game:
you will be told when you have escaped.

-   It's usual in an escape room to have little or no explanation about the kinds of
    puzzles that need to be solved, or how to escape. Participants have to figure that out
    for themselves as part of the fun. So don't give too much away when explaining how
    an escape room works
-   The room is designed to prompt discussion both during and after play, so encourage
    people to talk.
-   You don't need to know anything about RDM before playing the game: it is not a test.
    But some puzzles are harder than others! A little RDM knowledge, or experience
    playing escape rooms, might help you complete it faster.
-   Explain to participants what they should do to signal that they have completed the
    game.
-   Explain to participants what they should do if they need help whilst playing the
    game. Note that on some puzzle pages there is a link to a hint that will help complete
    the puzzle.

## Discussion points

Regardless of the audience, the game usually generates excitement and so it is worth making
some time immediately after playing to reflect, de-brief, and discuss the game together.

Possible discussion points include:

-   Did you like playing the game? Why (or why not!)?
-   Did anything surprise you when you played the game?
-   Did you learn anything, from the game itself or from your teammates?
-   Which question did you find most difficult to answer?
-   Do you think the Escape Room represents common issues in data management? How
    do these issues vary for different research areas? What issues have you personally
    encountered?
-   Did you have discussions with your teammates? What did you discuss?
-   Did anything during the game (including your struggles or mistakes) prompt you to
    think about why or how we should do research data management?
-   Whilst playing the game, did you see any parallels between the way you organised
    your team and the different roles in the research process?

Of course, as a facilitator, you may want to focus on certain discussion areas, add questions
that are relevant to your participants, or leave out discussion points that are not relevant.

## ⚠The sections below contain spoilers ⚠

*Do not read these sections if you want to play the game without knowing the answers.*

## How to play the Escape Room (⚠contains small spoilers)

-   There are 6 code puzzles, which can be solved in any order. All pages allow players to
    return to the central page from which they navigate to the puzzles. Each code puzzle
    delivers one word upon completion. The six words must be put into the correct order
    to unlock the final part of the game and escape.
-   The 'final' puzzle is to unlock the Professor's computer and submit the data
    management plan. The full computer code is obtained by completing the 6 code
    puzzles and working out the order of the words that makes most sense.
-   The game is a static website; it does not remember which puzzles have been
    completed or record a team's progress.
-   Hints are included at the bottom of pages where people have traditionally struggled
    (see the answers section below). You might need to give extra tips, or help players
    understand an answer.
-   Players have finished the game when they see the page with the open door that tells
    them they have escaped. It is possible that a team might believe they have
    completed the game before this point, so if a prize is involved, verify that they have
    reached the open door.
-   There is no formal record of when a team completes the game (but see the note
    below about the team-registration version). In a live event, a team can shout out
    when they have finished. Facilitators can, however, give more specific instructions to
    provide proof that the game was completed, and a time-stamp if that is relevant: tell
    participants in advance that they should take a screenshot when they escape so that
    they can prove that they have completed the game. If you are awarding a prize for
    the fastest team, the file will include a timestamp in the metadata, or you can ask
    them to make sure that the computer screen's clock is on the screenshot to prove
    the moment of escape.

NOTE on the team-registration version of the game:

There is a duplicate version of the Escape Room that is only available when facilitated by one
of the game’s creators and which allows teams to identify themselves and register their
completion time. In this team-registration version, players have to indicate their team name
at the last moment before they escape and a timestamp is recorded for that team. The
facilitators at VU have access to the environment where the team names and timestamps
are collected and can then identify the winning team. If interested, reach out to <rdm@vu.nl>

### Where people might get stuck..

-   Looking at the posters outside the room gives no useful information for completing
    the game, but is fun nonetheless!
-   The pile of waste paper in the bin is a distraction but might prompt discussion about
    how, and whether, data should be destroyed.
-   The map on the wall with numbers is a distraction that does not help with solving the
    puzzles, it is included merely for fun.
-   The notice board game is the most difficult - see the section below for more
    explanation. Players might find it better to come back to this puzzle after completing
    some of the other puzzles.
-   You are asked to read the data management plan (DMP) before submitting it - but
    this is not necessary to complete the game. All you have to do is to click 'Submit'.
    During discussion, you might like to return to the DMP (or your own institution's) to
    discuss data management planning in more detail.
-   Opening the data management plan is not quite the end… You have to click on the
    Submit button, and then click the final link to see the open door and the final
    message: "Thank you for submitting your Data Management Plan. We are pleased to
    inform you that your DMP has been accepted. You are free now to leave the office".
-   At the bottom of the final page, it's possible to leave feedback for the creators of the
    Data Horror Escape Room.

### Pablo's Orcid - the notice board puzzle

The notice board game is the most difficult and involves taking several steps to complete:

1.  understanding that an Orcid is a unique number identifying a person, in this case
    someone called " Pablo",
2.  realising that the instruction on the postcard to look at a dataset will lead to Pablo,
3.  working out how to find this dataset from the DOI (digital object identifier) that is given
    or spotting that there's a direct link on the DOI flyer),
4.  recognizing where to find Pablo's Orcid in the metadata of the dataset, and
5.  using the Orcid number to identify the right letters on the coded sheet back in the escape room.

Playing the game is an opportunity to encourage researchers to create their own Orcid, and
to explain why persistent identifiers are needed when archiving material on the web.

-   The two flyers on the notice board explain Orcid and DOIs and can be downloaded
    and printed out.
-   The coded sheet can only be deciphered if you know the ORCID number for Pablo
    Colunga-Salas. Pablo is a real researcher and is the first author of the (real) dataset
    mentioned on the postcard.
-   The DOI on the postcard can be googled to find the dataset, or the location can be
    found using the instructions on the DOI flyer, or there is even a direct URL-link from
    the example on the DOI flyer.
-   The DOI leads directly to the dataset created by Pablo Colunga-Salas and his
    colleagues, and from where the Orcid for Pablo can be found.
-   The dataset is called ‘Unicellular endoparasites of bats’ and is archived in Zenodo, so
    it is possible that players could locate the dataset with a few words from the title
    mentioned on the postcard, the name "Pablo", and the word "Zenodo".
-   The coded sheet also contains the word "PABLO" and other words that players might
    guess are relevant (metadata, ghosts, drives, means, etc.) but which are decoys. If
    players try enough of these variations in the final sentence, they may eventually find
    the right answer despite not having completed this puzzle.
